      <p>
        To support moderation and dispute resolution, chat messages and any attached files (images, videos,
        or other media) are securely stored for up to <strong>90 days</strong>. After that period, both messages
        and attachments are permanently deleted.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users can view their own chat history for up to 90 days.</li>
        <li>Authorised admin staff may access chat logs for moderation or legal reasons.</li>
        <li>Admins may download chat logs for compliance or abuse investigation purposes.</li>
        <li>All administrative access is strictly logged and restricted.</li>

      <h3>6. Media Uploads</h3>
      <p>
        Uploaded images and videos are subject to a <strong>60-day automatic deletion policy</strong>.
        Deleted media are moved to a secure holding folder for 30 days before being permanently removed.

      </p>

      <h3>7. Verification and Moderation</h3>
      <p>
        Before accessing certain platform features, users must complete manual photo verification.
        This involves submitting a photograph with a system-generated code written on paper to confirm authenticity.
        Human moderators review all verification submissions. AI-assisted tools may assist moderation,
        but final decisions are made by authorised human reviewers.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Account Management and Retention</h3>
      <p>
        User accounts and data are retained while the account is active. Accounts inactive for more than

        erase all related data, messages, and media.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
      <p>
        We use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your experience, improve performance,
        and measure analytics. You may disable cookies through your browser settings, but this may limit functionality.

      <h3>10. Data Security</h3>
      <p>
        We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption in transit and at rest,
        restricted access, and continuous monitoring. However, no system is 100% secure, and users share
        information at their own risk.
      </p>

      <h3>11. Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
      <p>
        We do not sell or rent your personal data. We may share limited information with trusted partners
        who help operate the platform, provided they comply with strict confidentiality and data protection standards.
