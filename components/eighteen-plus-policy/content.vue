      <h3>1. Adults Only</h3>
      <p>
        This platform is strictly for adults aged <strong>18 years and over</strong>. By accessing or creating an account, 
        you confirm that you meet the legal age requirement in your country or region. If you are under 18, 
        you must not register or use this platform.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Legal Compliance</h3>
      <p>
        To comply with <strong>UK and international regulations</strong>, LinkSwingers uses approved third-party 
        age-verification providers and internal verification methods to ensure that all members are aged 18 or above.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Verification Process</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Verification may include <strong>ID checks, biometric checks, card-based verification</strong>, or other legally recognised methods.</li>
        <li>Access may be temporarily limited until verification is completed.</li>
        <li>Any attempt to bypass or falsify age verification will result in permanent account removal and may be reported to authorities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Enforcement Policy</h3>
      <p>
        We operate a strict <strong>zero-tolerance policy</strong> toward underage access. Accounts found in violation 
        of age requirements will be permanently banned without notice.
